Codebook for the programming assignment Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data

The objective of this programming assignment is to transform an existing data set into a new tidy data with the mean values of the mean and standard deviation measurements.

This application uses data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available here: <!---SmartPhoneWebsiteUrl--><!---/SmartPhoneWebsiteUrl-->

Here are the data for the project: <!---DataFileUrl--><!---/DataFileUrl-->



###Data transformations

- Add the information form the activity and subject data to the training and test data.
- Merge the training data with the test data.
- Extract the mean and standard deviation measurements, i.e., variables containing mean(), std() or meanFreq() (vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample are not included).
- Replace variable names(feaures) by descriptive variable names.
- Calculate the mean values for each combination of activity, subject and measurement
